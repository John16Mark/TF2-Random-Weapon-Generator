# John16Mark's TF2 Random Weapon Generator
## Introduction
This is my personal take on a TF2 Weapon Generator. It was inspired by siko91's Weapon Generator:
https://siko91.github.io/tf2-weapon-generator/
I implemented some things differently (for example, the power level option) and added some features for a better experience.

There's several comboboxes for you to customize your generated weapon:
- The class and slot comboboxes are pretty straightforward: Select a specific option or leave it to chance.
- If you choose a specific class _and_ slot, you'll see some extra buttons so you can select which type of weapon you want.
- the positive and negative options are simple: Select how many stats of each type you want, if not, leave it to chance.
- The power level option is for those who like to see very ridiculous weapon ideas and imagine how they would work. Take into account that it might in some cases not do as intended given that it is working with random variables and such.
## Installation
You just need to download the latest release of **TF2_Weapon_Generator.jar** and run it
_(you need a program able to open runnable java applications:_ **_Java(TM) Platform SE Binary_**_)_
## Disclaimer
I am just starting to learn to create simple applications and I only know how to create them in Java, lol (funny, because its not even close to being my favorite language). There's lots of stuff I probably could be doing better (my code is kind of a mess and also most of it is in spanish, lol), but I really wanted to create something well done.

If you have ideas you want me to implement (like some stats you want me to add to the generator), let me know:
